# Sky

**Sky** is a comprehensive toolkit for [Starlark](https://github.com/bazelbuild/starlark) development, providing linting, formatting, testing, coverage, and documentation tools.

## What is Starlark?

Starlark is a configuration language originally designed for [Bazel](https://bazel.build/). It's a dialect of Python, making it familiar to most developers while being deterministic and hermetic.

## Why Sky?

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Linting" icon="warning">
    Catch bugs and enforce best practices with `skylint`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Formatting" icon="document">
    Consistent code style with `skyfmt`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Testing" icon="rocket">
    Test runner with assertions via `skytest`
  </Card>
  <Card title="Coverage" icon="approve-check">
    Code coverage collection with `skycov`
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Tools Overview

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `skylint` | Starlark linter with configurable rules |
| `skyfmt` | Code formatter for consistent style |
| `skytest` | Test runner with built-in assertions |
| `skycov` | Coverage reporter (text, JSON, Cobertura, LCOV) |
| `skydoc` | Documentation generator |
| `skycheck` | Static analyzer |
| `skyquery` | Query tool for Starlark codebases |
| `skyrepl` | Interactive REPL |

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install all tools
go install github.com/albertocavalcante/sky/cmd/...@latest

# Or install specific tools
go install github.com/albertocavalcante/sky/cmd/skylint@latest
go install github.com/albertocavalcante/sky/cmd/skytest@latest
```

## starlark-go-x

Sky is powered by [starlark-go-x](https://github.com/albertocavalcante/starlark-go-x), our enhanced fork of the official starlark-go interpreter with:

- **OnExec hook** for coverage instrumentation
- **Type annotation** parsing support

These features are being proposed upstream to the official [google/starlark-go](https://github.com/google/starlark-go) repository.
