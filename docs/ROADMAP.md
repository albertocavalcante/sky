# Roadmap

Short-term goals for the Starlark toolchain:

- Define a shared AST and parsing layer in `internal/starlark`.
- Implement `skyfmt` for deterministic formatting.
- Implement `skylint` with configurable rule sets.
- Add `skyquery` for searching and introspecting Starlark files.
- Grow the plugin marketplace format and publishing workflow.
